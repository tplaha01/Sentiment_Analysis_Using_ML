# Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on performing **sentiment analysis** on textual data using a combination of **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques and **machine learning models**. The goal is to classify text into categories such as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**, thereby helping in understanding the emotional tone behind words.

## 🧠 Project Description

Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in various industries like marketing, finance, politics, and customer service. In this project, we:

- Collected and preprocessed textual data
- Applied NLP techniques for cleaning and feature extraction
- Trained multiple machine learning models for sentiment classification
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy and classification reports
- Visualized the results for better interpretability

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing (stopwords removal, stemming, etc.)
- TF-IDF and CountVectorizer for text vectorization
- Model training using Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.
- Performance evaluation and accuracy comparison
- Word clouds and confusion matrices for insights

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK
- **ML Models**: Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM)


## 📊 Results

| Model                  | Accuracy |
|-----------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression   | 88%      |
| Naive Bayes           | 86%      |
| Support Vector Machine| 89%      |

> *Note: Accuracy may vary depending on the dataset and preprocessing steps.*

## 🔍 Future Improvements

- Integration with live data from Twitter or product reviews
- Fine-tuning using deep learning models like LSTM or BERT
- Multi-language support
